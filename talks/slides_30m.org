* Introduction
** _Very quick overview of the talk_
   + Out-of-sample tests: assess one or more models by
     1) producing a series of forecasts
     2) testing hypotheses about their properties (unbiasedness, MDS, etc.)
     e.g. Meese and Rogoff (1983), Diebold-Mariano-West, etc.
   + $P$ --- number of observations in test sample
   + $R$ --- number of observations in training sample

   {{{s}}}

   + Propose a straightforward block bootstrap
     - Works well when the statistic fits West's (1996) framework
     - Extensions to nested and overlapping models "soon"
   + Monte Carlo evidence of finite-sample performance
   + Empirical exercise based on Goyal and Welch (2008)
     + (but there's not going to be time)
** _Basic setup and notation_
   OOS statistics have the form
   \begin{align*}
   \fb &= \oavg{t} f(y_{t+1}, x_t, \bh_{1t},\dots,\bh_{kt}) \\
       &\equiv \oavg{t} f_t(\bh_{1t},\dots,\bh_{kt}),
   \end{align*}

   + $f$ --- criterion for comparing forecasting models (scalar in the talk)
     + Equal MSE: $f_t(\beta_1,\beta_2) = (y_{t+1} - x_{1t}'\beta_1)^2 - (y_{t+1} - x_{2t}'\beta_2)^2$
   + $y_{t+1}$ --- target variable of interest; $t = 1,\dots,T-1$
   + $x_t$ --- vector of predictors
     + $x_{it}$ --- the vector of predictors for model $i$
   + $\bh_{it}$ --- parameter estimates for model $i$
** _Estimation strategies_
   Each $\bh_{it}$ is an $M$-estimator calculated with data that would
   be available to a forecaster in period $t$:

   \begin{equation*}
   \hat\beta_{it} = \begin{cases}
   \argmin_\beta \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} q_i(y_{s+1}, x_s, \beta) & \text{recursive window} \\ \\
   \argmin_\beta \sum_{s=t-R+1}^{t-1} q_i(y_{s+1}, x_s, \beta) & \text{(\emph{rolling window})} \\ \\
   \argmin_\beta \sum_{s=1}^{R-1} q_i(y_{s+1}, x_s, \beta) & \text{(\emph{fixed window})},
   \end{cases}
   \end{equation*}

   + Should be straightforward to extend results to other estimation
     strategies (GMM, for example), but I haven't done it
     + Allows comparison with prev. results (Corradi and Swanson, 2007)
   + For the talk, let $k = 1$ (our assumptions ensure nondegeneracy)
** _We're operating in the West/Clark/McCracken world_
   + Inference, not point estimation
   + Null hypothesis of interest is $\E f_t(\beta_0) = 0$,
     \[
       \beta_{0} = \argmin_\beta \E q(y_{t+1}, x_t, \beta) \qquad\text{(pseudotrue parameter)}
     \]
   + Not looking at...
     + Giacomini and White's (2006) null (comparison of /forecast methods/)
     + Diebold and Mariano's (1995) null (comparison of /forecasts/) \newline (See Diebold, 2015)
     + Calhoun's (2014) null (comparison of /generalization error/)
   + Assuming West's (1996) asymptotics apply (nonnested models)
     \[
       \sqrt{P}\ (\ \fb - \E f_t(\beta_0)) \to^d N(0, \Sigma)
     \]
** _Bootstraps (particularly Circular Block Bootstrap)_
   + We're using block bootstraps in this paper
     + Focus on the Circular Bootstrap for talk (Politis and Romano, 1992)
     + $\ell$ --- block length
   + Generate $\ell / T$ uniform $1,\dots,T$ random variables $u_1$, $u_2$,\dots
     \begin{align*}
       (y^*_1, x^*_1) &= (y_{u_1}, x_{u_1}) \\
       (y^*_2, x^*_2) &= (y_{u_1+1}, x_{u_1+1}) \\
       &\vdots \\
       (y^*_\ell, x^*_\ell) &= (y_{u_1+\ell-1}, x_{u_1+\ell-1}) \\
       (y^*_{\ell+1}, x^*_{\ell+1}) &= (y_{u_2}, x_{u_2}) \\
       &\vdots
     \end{align*}
   + If $u_j + k > n$, use $u_j + k - n$ as the index instead
** _Our proposed approach_
   Bootstrap OOS statistics exactly as you would expect
   \begin{align*}
   \fb^* &= \oavg{t} f(y_{t+1}^*, x_t^*, \bh_{t}^*) \\
         &\equiv \oavg{t} f_t^*(\bh_{t}^*),
   \end{align*}
   where (for the recursive window; other windows are similar)
   \[
      \hat\beta_{t}^* =
      \argmin_\beta \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} q(y_{s+1}^*, x_s^*, \beta).
   \]
   + Informal result:
     $\quad\sqrt{P}\, (\, \fb^* - \E^* f_t^*(\beta_0^*)) \to^d N(0, \Sigma)$
   + $\E^*$ --- expectation under bootstrap distribution
** _Theorem 1 --- the bootstrap is consistent_
  Under Assumptions 1 -- 5 (we'll get to them),
  $\var(\fb)/\var^*(\fb^*) \to^p 1$
  and
  \begin{multline*}
    \pr\big[\sup_x \big\lvert \pr^*[\sqrt{P}\ (\ \fb^* - \E^* f_t^*(\beta_0^*)) \leq x] \\ -
    \pr[\sqrt{P}\ (\ \bar{f} - \E f_t(\beta_0)) \leq x] \big\rvert > \epsilon\big] \to 0
  \end{multline*}
  for all $\epsilon > 0$.

  + $\beta^*_0 = \bh_T = \argmin_\beta \tfrac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} q(y_{t+1}, x_t, \beta)$
  + $\E^* f^*_t(\beta_0^*) \approx \tfrac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B \fb_{i}^*$
    + $\fb_i^*$ is the OOS average in the \(i\)th replication

  tl;dr --- the [circular] block bootstrap works

** Sneak peek of Monte Carlo results --- "sanity check"

   [[../montecarlo/west_iv_slides.pdf]]

   + Vertical axis is $P$, 10% nominal size
   + Size not egregiously bad but somewhat undersized
   + "Naive bootstrap" just resamples the $\hat f_R,\dots,\hat f_{T-1}$ and is bad
   + We'll discuss the MC design later in the talk
** _Why is this novel? An extremely short literature review_
   + Most of the literature has focused on nested models
     + Approaches developed for nested models tend to be model-based
     + Kilian (1998), Clark and McCracken (multiple papers)
   + OOS block bootstrap literature started by bootstrapping $\fh_t$ directly
     + e.g. White (2000) and Hansen (2005)
     + Has required $P$ to be small --- $(P/R) \log \log R \to 0$
   + Problem in general: $\hat\beta_t$ is not necessarily close to $\beta_0^*$ unless $P$ is small
     + Corradi and Swanson (2007) develop a correction to the
       $\hat\beta_t^*$ to account for this difference ---
       $\hat\beta_t^*$ must be estimated differently than $\hat\beta_t$
* Basic assumptions
** _Assumption 1 (estimators)_
   + $\hat \beta_{t}$ and $\hat \beta_{t}^*$ are $M$-estimators as defined earlier
   + $\beta_{0} = \argmin_\beta \E\, q_{s}(\beta)$ is uniquely identified
   + $\beta_{0}$ is an element of a compact set $\Theta$.
** _Assumption 2 (moments and smoothness)_
   + $f_t(\beta)$ and $q_{t}(\beta)$ are almost surely twice
     continuously differentiable in an open neighborhood $N$ of
     $\beta_0$
   + $\E \nabla^2 q_t(\beta)$ is positive definite uniformly in $N$
   + There exists a sequence of random variables $m_t$ such that (a.s.)
     + $\sup_{\beta \in N} |\nabla^2 q_{t}(\beta)| \leq m_t$,
     + $\sup_{\beta \in N} |\nabla^2 f_t(\beta)| \leq m_t$,
     + $\sup_{\beta \in N} |\nabla q_{t}(\beta)| \leq m_t$, and
     + $\sup_{\beta \in N} |\nabla f_t(\beta)| \leq m_t$
     $\E m_t^r$ is uniformly finite, with $r > 2$

     {{{s}}}

   Here $q_t(\beta) = q(y_{t+1}, x_t, \beta)$

** _Assumption 3 (stationarity and weak dependence)_
   + The stochastic process
     \[
       (f_t(\beta_0), \nabla f_t(\beta_0), \nabla q_{t}(\beta_0), \nabla^2 q_t(\beta_0))
     \]
     is weakly stationary
   + $(y_{t+1}, x_t)$ is strong-mixing of size $-r/(r-2)$ or uniform
     mixing of size $-r/(2r-2)$ with $r>2$.
** _Assumption 4 (non-nestedness)_
   The asymptotic variance of $\fb$ is uniformly positive.
** _Assumption 5 (sample split, bootstrap)_
   + $R, P \to \infty$ as $T \to \infty$.
   + The bootstrap sequence $(y_2^*, x_1^*),\dots,(y_T^*, x_{T-1}^*)$
     is constructed using a moving blocks, circular blocks, or
     stationary bootstrap with block lengths drawn from the geometric
     distribution.
   + The (expected) block length $\ell$ satisfies $\ell \to \infty$
     and $\ell/T \to 0$.
* Main result and remarks
** _Theorem 1 --- the bootstrap is (still) consistent_
  Under Assumptions 1 -- 5,
  $\var(\fb)/\var^*(\fb^*) \to^p 1$
  and
  \begin{multline*}
    \pr\big[\sup_x \big\lvert \pr^*[\sqrt{P}\ (\ \fb^* - \E^* f_t^*(\beta_0^*)) \leq x] \\ -
    \pr[\sqrt{P}\ (\ \bar{f} - \E f_t(\beta_0)) \leq x] \big\rvert > \epsilon\big] \to 0
  \end{multline*}
  for all $\epsilon > 0$.

  {{{s}}}

  + $\beta^*_0 = \argmin_\beta \tfrac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} q(y_{t+1}, x_t, \beta)$
  + $\E^* \fb^*_t \approx \tfrac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B \fb_{i}^*$
    + $\fb_i^*$ is the OOS average in the \(i\)th replication

  {{{s}}}

  tl;dr --- the [circular] block bootstrap works
** _Thumbnail sketch of a proof_
   + Proof follows West (1996) and McCracken (2000) very
     closely
   + Expand $f^*_t(\bh_t^*)$ around $\beta_0^*$ (not around $\bh_t$)
     \begin{align*}
       \sqrt{P}\ (\ \fb^* - \E^* f_t^*(\beta_0^*))
       &= \oclt{t} (\, f_t^*(\beta_0^*) - \E^* f_t^*(\beta_0^*)) \\ &\quad + \oclt{t} \nabla f_t^*(\beta_0^*) \cdot (\bh_t^* - \btrue^*) + o_{p^*}(1)
     \end{align*}
   + Both summations obey CLTs and have mean zero (under bootstrap-induced distribution)
   + Converges to the same limiting distribution as the original OOS average
** COMMENT _Theorem 2_
   If
   + Assumptions 1 -- 5 hold
   + $f_t - \E f_t(\beta_0)$ is an MDS
   + i.i.d. bootstrap is used instead of block bootstrap.

   {{{s}}}

   Then, for all $\epsilon > 0$,
   \[
     \var(\fb)/\var^*(\fb^*) \to^p 1
   \]
   and
   \begin{multline*}
   \pr\big[\sup_x \big\lvert \pr^*[\sqrt{P}\, (\,\fb^* - \E^* f_t^*(\beta_0^*)) \leq x] \\ -
   \pr[\sqrt{P}\,(\, \bar{f} - \E f_t) \leq x] \big\rvert > \epsilon\big] \to 0
   \end{multline*}
* Monte Carlo exercise
** _Basic MC setup_
   + Very simple (and preliminary, more realistic sims needed...)
   + Originally proposed by West (1996)
     + example where correct SE matter
     \begin{align*}
     y_t &=  w_{1t} + w_{2t} + v_t \\
     w_{it} &= z_{it} + v_t \\
     (v_t, z_{1t}, z_{2t}) &\sim \text{i.i.d.}\ N(0, I_3).
     \end{align*}
   + forecasting models are $y_t = \alpha_i + \beta_i
     w_{it} + u_{it}$
   + Coefficients estimated with IV using $z_{it}$ as instrument
     + so performance is a proxy for other aspects of the model
     + *Not* an $M$-estimator, so we can't use CS approach
** _Basic MC setup_
   Comparison is OOS MSE
   \[
   \fb = \tfrac{1}{P} \sum_{t=R+1}^T \big((y_t - \hat\alpha_{1t} - \hat\beta_{1t} w_{1t})^2 - (y_t - \hat\alpha_{2t} - \hat\beta_{2t} w_{2t})^2\big)
   \]
   Use bootstrap to generate critical values for two-sided test at 10%

* Empirical example
** _Goyal and Welch (2008) empirical study_
   * Goyal and Welch (2008) look out out-of-sample excess return
     predictability
     * excess returns measured as the difference between the yearly
       log return of the S\&P 500 index and the T-bill interest rate
   * They find that none of the variables thought to predict excess
     returns based on in-sample evidence successfully predict
     out-of-sample
   * Benchmark model is the excess return's sample mean
   * Alternative models are of the form
     \begin{equation*}
       \mathit{excess~return}_{t+1} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}\
       \mathit{predictor}_{t} + \ep_{t+1},
     \end{equation*}

   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_col: 0.45
   :END:
   * Use annual data beginning in 1927 and ending in 2009
** _OOS test statistic_
   + Use the test statistic proposed by Calhoun (2015)
   + Estimate $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ for each predictor using OLS
     with a 10-year rolling window
     + Produces forecasts $\hat y_{it}$
   + Benchmark is the sample mean calculated with \emph{recursive window}
     + Call these forecasts $\hat y_{0t}$
   + The OOS statistic is a Clark-West type adjusted squared-error
     \begin{equation*}
       \fb_i = \tfrac{1}{P} \osum{t}
         \big[(y_{t+1} - \hat y_{0,t+1})^2 - (y_{t+1} - \hat y_{i,t+1})^2 + (\hat y_{0,t+1} - \hat y_{i,t+1})^2 \big]
     \end{equation*}
   + This statistic is asymptotically normal under null that
     $y_{t+1} - \E y_{t+1}$ is MDS (see Calhoun, 2015)
** _Accounting for multiple models_
   + Plan to conduct 14 one-sided tests
   + We use the bootstrap to implement an BRC-type test (White, 2000)
   + Studentized statistics (using Calhoun's variance formula)
   + Remove variables with statistics less than SPA threshold (about
     --1.7, none of the variables) --- Hansen (2005)
   + Use the bootstrap to estimate the distribution of
     \[
     \max_i \sqrt{P}\ \frac{\fb_i - \E f_{it}(\beta_0)}{\hat\sigma_i}
     \]
     + Use the 0.9 quantile of this distribution as our 10% critical value
   + Two bootstraps:
     + ``BRC'' bootstrap: bootstrap $\hat f_t$ directly
     + Approach proposed in this paper
     + Both with block length of 1 (MDS null)

   + "v. naive" --- compare to single-model critical value (1.28)
   + "BRC" --- bootstrap observed OOS values (1.27)
   + "ours" --- full MDS bootstrap proposed in this paper (2.67)
   + Goyal and Welch remain un-overturned
* Conclusion
** _Summary_
   + Read the paper, it's not so bad
   + Block bootstraps work as expected for OOS statistics
     + Potentially useful approach when the variance is awkward
     + Bootstrapping the OOS forecast errors directly
       can do quite poorly
   + Simulations based on West's (1996) MC design support our theory
     + (this isn't a simulation that I tailored to support my statistic)
   + Empirical exercise showing how to use it for BRC-type tests

   _Logical next steps_

   {{{s}}}

   + Bootstrapping real time data (joint project with Todd Clark and
     Mike McCracken)
   + Extend results to nested and overlapping models
   + More comprehensive simulations for this paper!
