oosbootstrap overview
=====================

This repository contains the code and data for my (Gray Calhoun's)
unreleased paper *A simple block bootstrap for asymptoticall normal
out-of-sample test statistics*. The current version of the paper is
very preliminary and the mathematical results almost certainly have
errors. You can find the latest version of this repository at
<https://git.ece.iastate.edu/gcalhoun/oosbootstrap>.

This repository is for development after the "2014-04-01" version of
the paper.  The paper is an offshoot of another paper,
"An asymptotically normal out-of-sample test based on mixed estimation
windows."
